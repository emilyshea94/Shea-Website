## Description

Horiseon orignal code refactored and optimized by me so that it can be funtional to a user. 
I ran into a few roadblocks with creating the header and had to add some code to the index.html to get the bullet points to dissapear. 
I spent a lot of time getting the "digital marketing meeting" image to be the right size and in line withe the rest of the page. 
I had to play around with the perctages in css and added height and width into the html itself and not just the css for said image.
I spent quite a while adjusting the font and image sizing percentages and hope in the future to memorize the diffent sizes without having to go back and forth.
While doing this challenge I memorized how to "push" changes wihtout looking at a command cheat sheet.
